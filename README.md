📘 Challenge: Project Management API
📖 Scenario:
Your company wants to build an internal Project Management API for managing projects, collaborators, and tasks. You need to design and implement a backend that:

Supports project planning and execution

Tracks collaborators and their tasks

Offers reporting features (e.g., hours worked, task completion rate)

🧩 Requirements
Entities:
1. Project
Id (GUID)

Name (string, required)

StartDate (DateTime)

EndDate (DateTime?)

Status (enum: Planned, InProgress, Completed, Cancelled)

Tasks (collection of Task)

TeamMembers (many-to-many with Collaborators)

2. Task
Id (GUID)

Title (string, required)

Description (string?)

EstimatedHours (decimal)

LoggedHours (decimal)

Status (enum: Todo, InProgress, Done)

AssignedTo (Collaborator?)

ProjectId (FK)

3. Collaborator
Id (GUID)

FullName (string)

Email (string)

Tasks (collection of Task)

Projects (many-to-many with Projects)

✨ Features to Implement
✅ CRUD:
Create, update, delete, and get Projects, Collaborators, and Tasks

🔍 Filtering:
List all tasks assigned to a collaborator, filterable by status and due date

List all projects with incomplete tasks

📊 Aggregates:
Get total logged hours per project

Get completion percentage per project

👤 Custom Endpoints:
Assign a task to a collaborator

Add/remove a collaborator to/from a project

Change task status with validation (e.g., only allow "Done" if LoggedHours >= EstimatedHours)

🧪 Bonus Features (Optional):
Pagination and sorting

Global exception handling

Soft delete (e.g., IsDeleted)

AsyncAPI or Pub/Sub events on Task completion (advanced)

🛠️ Tech Stack
.NET 9 (Minimal API or Controllers)

EF Core 9 (Code-First)

SQL Server / SQLite (your choice)

FluentValidation (optional)

AutoMapper (optional)

xUnit + Moq for testing
